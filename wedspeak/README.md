### What is it

This is a mobile app where users can record messages for loved ones at weddings/important functions. It has a very simple UI starting with a page to record your message, then you type in your name, and finally you save your message.

### Tools Used

- react native
- expo (SDK)
- react navigation

### Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced when making this project was making it extremely simple to use. I wanted to make it so anyone regardless of if they can read english fully would be able to navigate through the app can save a message for their loved one. I feel like I accomplished this by making sure buttons had images and making certain navigation buttons only appear when the user had completed what they needed to do on a page. Also making the app extremely minimal and not adding extra noise no make the app flashy helped a lot as well.

Another challenge I faced was learning React Native quickly. Luckily it works almost exactly like react with a UI framework. Also the documentation was very straight foreword so it was very easy to use it's SDK.
